              <p>Do It Early is an app that helps you keep on track through user interaction. With this app, users can also set a start time for the assignment, and delay it if necessary. Throughout the project, we received feedback through our peers, which helped us iterate on the idea. Here, I will go over the design process and the thinking behind our idea.</p>

                <p>Our first step is to find out what people actually need. We did interviews and observations to develop the core idea for our app. In a nutshell, we found out that people easily get distracted and often can't accurately predict how long a project will take him/her. Therefore, we decided to develop a planner app where users can stay on track, as well as have some sort of time management system.

                <p>The next step was to have volunteers try out our app and give off feedback based on criteria called "hueristics". There, a score was given out for each hueristic category, with 0 being no trouble, to 4 being needs immediate changes. We used feedback to change our prototype as we were coding the app.

                <p>Here, we started coding the app. We changed a lot of things in the final prototype. For example, first, we had users select the assignment date through drop down boxes. These boxes would highlight yellow if the user inputs the wrong data. We realized this was very hectic as users would spend up to a minute just to set up his/her assignnment.

                <p>To iterate on our design we tested out another layout of the enter details page, with no drop downs and used google analytics to track the time people spent on the different designs. It turns out that replacing dropdowns with calendars and clocks helped speed up the process significantly.

        <h2> The Take Away </h2>
        <p>DoItEarly was an interesting project: not only were we tasked with coding, but also the design. I learned how to apply the design process as well as critique other app prototypes. I was amazed at how every aspect mattered from intuitive user flow to correct wording on buttons. In terms of coding, I learned basic backend concepts using Node-Js as well as refining my web development skills with html, css, and javascript. DoItEarly isn't fully funcitonal yet as it is only a prototype. The prototype itself could also be improved upon, such as making the front end look nicer with visuals. However, the development of DoItEarly has been quite a learning experience thanks to my wonderful teammates.

                <p>As avid NBA fans, we are interested in not just the gameplay of basketball, but the statistics behind it. It is said that good teams have at least one superstar on them, someone contributes stats that are higher than most other players. However, there are so many other factors that lead to a team's success, including having a good defense, a good offense, good coaching, good role players, etc. Teams tend to have different strengths and weaknesses, with a combination many factors determining if they do well or not. Although there are many statistics present, we want to see if we can determine what statistical trends (if any) that generally result in success in the NBA.<u>(Note: we will be testing data on all teams from the 2000-2001 season to the 2016-2017 season)</u>

              <p><b>Research Question:</b> What makes a 21st century NBA team good? With 30 teams, we define a “good” team as one that finishes within the top 8 in regards to number of wins (during the regular season). Due to their success in the regular season, these good teams are most likely to be the most successful in the NBA playoffs.
              <p>
              <p><b>Hypothesis:</b> We believe that the defining characteristic of a good NBA team will be those with a higher average impact across its players, with the least amount of variance between players. Impact will be defined as the sum of the weighted factors of points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals, and turnovers per game for each player in one team. All 6 of these factors will be weighed based on how they affect teams in scoring and/or preventing opposing teams from scoring.

              We found a very helpful API called nba_py that would scrape and organize data from nba.com. Here is an example of a class within the API called TeamStats. The constructor will initialize a TeamStats object, first with default data from the constants file. This object contains some important fields we will want to use later such as "rank." In order to actually instantiate a TeamStats object with useful data, we can input some parameters from the self.JSON section. For example: TeamStats(team_id = 1610612737, season ='2000-01').overall() will essentially scrape data from a specific basketball team (the Atlanta Hawks) from a specific season (2000-2001 season).

               After we had imported all the data, we split certain parts of the available data in certain ways so that we could more efficiently use it the way we wanted to. We first grouped the data into dataframes for all of the individual players’ stats from each season. We had one dataframe for each season from 2000 to 2016, which included all the players in the entire NBA league, as well as many player statistics apart from the six that we were going use to calculate impact. These other statistics included age, games won and lost, rankings for each statistic, and even number of fantasy points, amongst others.

              <p>
              For each year, we used our CSV files to visualize the data for each of the six categories used to calculate total impact. We created histograms in which we graphed the points, blocks, steals, assists, rebounds, and turnovers per game against the frequency, in this case the number of players who fell into particular ranges for each statistic. So we would have 6 histograms for each year (from 2000 to 2016). These allowed us to determine how the data was distributed, and helped us decide how we should calculate the weights for each category.The points per game histogram for 2016 shown on the left, for example, signifies that the greatest number of players scored about 7 points per game.

              <p>
              Since every category's distribution tested positive for being a log-normal distribution, we needed to normalize each distribution in order to use the z-score test for our impact calculations (z-score tests are only effective when the distribution is normal). In order to do so, we looped through the list of dataframes and converting the values of each category (points, assists, turnovers, rebounds, steals and blocks) to their log values.

              <p>
              Next, we used the newly normalized values to create a list for each category's average value and standard deviation for every year. Because we are essentially measuring how good a player is, we need to determine the amount of points for each of the 6 categories. We settled for the following:              
              </p>
              <p>
                <li><u>Points</u> are worth 1, as each corresponds to an actual point in the game.</li>
                <li><u>Rebounds</u> are worth 1.2, as they do not necessarily lead to a score but give more opportunities for them.</li>
                <li><u>Blocks</u> are worth 2.3, as it prevents a potential 2-3 points from being made (2 is more common than 3 so we chose 2.3 instead of 2.5).</li>
                <li><u>Steals</u> are worth 1.8, as they are more significant than rebounds due to likelihood of fastbreak.</li>
                <li><u>Assists</u> are worth 2.3, as they always lead to a score and so they are the opposite of blocks.</li>
                <li><u>Turnovers</u> are worth -1.8, as they are the opposite of steals.</li>

                  <p>Our first step is to find out what people actually need. We did interviews and observations to develop the core idea for our app. In a nutshell, we found out that people easily get distracted and often can't accurately predict how long a project will take him/her. Therefore, we decided to develop a planner app where users can stay on track, as well as have some sort of time management system.
